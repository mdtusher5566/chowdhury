# Reflection on Cybersecurity Portfolio  

Completing the TryHackMe rooms helped me grow both technically and professionally.  

- **Technical Growth:** I learned how governance frameworks such as NIST CSF and PCI DSS shape organizational security, and I practiced ethical hacking techniques in a safe environment.  
- **Professional Growth:** Documenting my work in a structured report and portfolio improved my ability to communicate technical findings clearly, which is a vital skill for SOC Analysts and cybersecurity consultants.  
- **Challenges:** I faced difficulty in setting up VPN access for TryHackMe and interpreting scan results, but overcame them by using documentation and forums.  
- **Future Improvements:** I plan to complete more advanced rooms (medium difficulty) and include incident response simulations using tools such as Wireshark or Zeek.  

This portfolio strengthens my employability by providing tangible evidence of my cybersecurity skills.
